&nbsp;

<strong>The roundtable, <em>Democracy, Journalism &amp; Literacy in the era of post-truth</em> is organised by CMPF (the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom) and EAVI (the European Association for Viewers Interests), hosted by MEPs Barbara Spinelli and Curzio Maltese.</strong>

Freedom of expression and freedom and pluralism of the media are fundamental rights and principles enshrined in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. Media pluralism and media freedom are essential to guarantee a democratic environment for all EU citizens and constitute the foundations of any healthy democratic society: they are conditions to guarantee that individuals have access to a variety of information and may form their opinions by taking into account different perspectives and points of view. Internet, the World Wide Web and Social Media have enhanced the opportunities for citizens to contribute to the public discourse.

Within this evolving media landscape, web platforms, mobile applications and digital devices are increasingly affecting the creation, dissemination and consumption of news and other information. While these  technologies offer plentiful opportunities for citizens to be informed and actively participate in the public debate, it is also the primary vehicle for the massive diffusion and amplification of dis-information and other harmful or potentially deceiving content.
<h3><a href=""https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfNdqwu_uMIFzxpmSuy3H_t0ngW5bfStzx0HUX3C4EimmiQcw/viewform"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">Click here to register for the event. </a></h3>
&nbsp;

The event will focus on three interrelated topics.

First, it will discuss the evolving concept of media freedom and media pluralism in the digital media landscape, the possible new parameters to measure the risks that freedom of expression, pluralism and, in the end, democracy may face in the online environment. While thinking of regulatory solutions to growing dis- and mis-information online is challenging and risky, new policy instruments should be studies to tackle these phenomena (i.e. an independent monitoring of risks posed to freedom of expression and pluralism online, exploiting the methodology of the Media Pluralism Monitor, carried out by the CMPF).

One response to the growing challenges brought by dis- and mis- information online is media literacy. Thus, the second part of the event will reflect on the importance of developing a common understanding and measures to increase media literacy as a set of skills to empower people to produce content and to critically think about information that is being served to them. The content and results of #MyStory – the EAVI project designed to employ media literacy competencies to create counter-narratives to mainstream media discourse on migrants and refugees – will be presented.

The role of professional journalists in separating facts from fiction and to provide  information of public interest is today more indispensable than ever. However, due to the crisis of traditional media economic models and increasingly precarious working conditions of journalists, quality journalism is at stake. The final part of the event will concentrate on these issues and possible sustainable industrial and policy solutions.

The overall aim of the event is to inform the debate and call for action, including policies at EU level, to study, understand and protect necessary conditions for freedom of expression, pluralism and, in the end for a healthy democracy in the so called era of “post-truth”.

<h2>Monitoring media pluralism in Europe: between old risks and new threats</h2>
&nbsp;

The Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM) is a holistic tool to assess the risks to media pluralism in a given country. It is based on a set of twenty indicators covering a broad notion of media pluralism that encompasses political, cultural, geographical, structural and content-related dimensions. The risks for media pluralism are measured in four different areas: Basic Protection, Market Plurality, Political Independence and Social Inclusiveness. The indicators cover legal, economic and socio-political questions.

In 2017, the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom carried out the EU-wide implementation of the Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM2017). The MPM2017 also covers three candidate countries (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRoM), Serbia and Turkey).

The results of the MPM2017 monitoring exercise generally confirm the highlights of the previous rounds of the MPM’s implementation (see <a href=""https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener"">https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/</a>): none of the analysed countries is free from risks to media pluralism. The latest findings show either a stagnation or a deterioration in all of the four major areas covered by the MPM, and an increase in risk for the area of Basic protection is a particular source of concern.

In addition to the “traditional” sources of risks to media pluralism, the contemporary digital environment brings challenges. The growing dominance of a few digital intermediaries and social platforms strongly affects the news business, news distribution and audience habits. Algorithms, artificial intelligence and automation are already applied in many aspects of information production and distribution. It has opened a Pandora’s Box of opportunities, but also threats such as spread of online disinformation and hate speech, (mis-)use of personal data for targeted information, political advertising, non-transparent content moderation, net neutrality violations, to name a few.

In keeping with the event’s name “between old risks and new threats”, we will first present and discuss the latest findings of the Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM2017). Second, an afternoon roundtable discussion featuring scholars, experts, stakeholders and policy-makers from around Europe, will draw our attention to more recent digital-related challenges in an effort to define potential indicators to be measured, using the risk-based logic of the Media Pluralism Monitor.

<strong>Chair:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Prof. Pier Luigi Parcu, Director of the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom</li>
</ul>
<strong>Speakers:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Urška Umek (Head of Media Unit, Information Society Department, Council of Europe)</li>

</ul>
The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted more than ever the importance of professional journalism and quality reporting in our contemporary societies. The CMPF’s Media Pluralism Monitor 2020 has found that the poor working conditions of journalists and the increasing number of threats to which journalists are subjected pose some of the greatest risks to journalism in Europe. In the months following the data collection, the pandemic has further accelerated these problems. In these extraordinary times, journalists have put their health and well-being at risk to provide quality news to citizens, while the infodemic is raging.

However, despite their fundamental role, news media and journalists are facing a series of challenges that could greatly impair function: financial difficulties, constant attacks to the freedom of expression, and at times even physical attacks. In the webinar session, distinguished experts will discuss the major security threats looming over the journalistic profession: The acquittal of the accused mastermind of Ján Kuciak’s murder has shown that perpetrators are shielded by impunity, even inside the EU. At our borders, in Belarus, authorities are detaining journalists for simply doing their job and covering protests. But if we look beyond the headlines, we can find a range of additional problems affecting journalists in Europe -- among them burn-outs, job (in)security and precarious employment, all of which were accelerated by COVID-19.

In the first <a href=""https://ec.europa.eu/digital-single-market/en/news/rule-law-first-annual-report-rule-law-situation-across-european-union"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">Annual Report on the Rule of Law</a> situation in the European Union published in September 2020, the European Commission evaluated the media pluralism and freedom situation in the 27 member states and raised some issues regarding media practices. Among those exist concerns about the political independence of media, the risks of politicisation of media authorities, threats to journalists in retaliation for their work, the scarcity of adequate resources for new media outlets, and more.  The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has further aggravated this situation and many measures taken to tackle the ‘infodemic’ appeared to be used for political purposes. In this context, what are the next steps planned by the European Commission to support the media sector?

The Robert Schuman Centre and The Centre for Media Pluralism and Freedom are honoured to host European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Věra Jourová, to answer that question. The dialogue will feature an introduction from the Director of the Robert Schuman Centre, Brigid Laffan and will be chaired by Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom Director, Pier Luigi Parcu.
