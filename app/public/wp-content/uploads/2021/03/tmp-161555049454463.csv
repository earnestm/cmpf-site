It is based on a set oftwenty indicators covering a broad notion of media pluralism that encompasses political, cultural, geographical, structural and content-related dimensions. The risks for media pluralism are measured in four different areas: Basic Protection, Market Plurality, Political Independence and Social Inclusiveness. The indicators cover legal, economic and socio-political questions. In 2017, the Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom carried out the EU-wide implementation of the Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM2017). The MPM2017 also covers three candidate countries (the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYRoM), Serbia and Turkey). The results of the MPM2017 monitoring exercise generally confirm the highlights of the previous rounds of the MPM’s implementation (see https://cmpf.eui.eu/media-pluralism-monitor/): none of the analysed countries is free from risks to media pluralism. The latest findings show either a stagnation or a deterioration in all of the four major areas covered by the MPM, and an increase inrisk for the area of Basic protection is a particular source of concern. In addition to the “traditional” sources of risks to media pluralism, the contemporary digital environment brings challenges. The growing dominance of a few digital intermediaries and social platforms strongly affects the news business, news distribution and audience habits. Algorithms, artificial intelligence and automation are already applied in many aspects ofinformation production and distribution. It has opened a Pandora’s Box ofopportunities, but also threats such as spread of online disinformation and hate speech, (mis-)use of personal data for targeted information, political advertising, non-transparent content moderation, net neutrality violations, to name a few. In keeping with the event’s name “between oldrisks and new threats”, we will first present and discuss the latest findings of the Media Pluralism Monitor (MPM2017). Second, an afternoon roundtable discussion featuring scholars, experts, stakeholders and policy-makers from around Europe, will draw our attention to more recent digital-related challenges in an effort to define potential indicators to be measured, using the risk-based logic of the Media Pluralism Monitor. CMPF staff, including director Pier Luigi Parcu, scientific coordinator Elda Brogi and researchers Iva Nenadic and Mario Viola de Azevedo Cunha will present the results of the 2017 Media Pluralism Monitor. The MPM project is co-funded by the European Union.   REGISTER FOR THE EVENT   SEE THE EVENT PROGRAMME  List of Guest Speakers        Giuseppe Abbamonte     Giuseppe Abbamonte was appointed Director of the Media and Data Directorate in January 2014.

The webinar is part of the 9th edition of the annual School for Journalists and Media Practitioners organised by the Centre for Media Pluralism and Freedom (CMPF), at the European University Institute, and will be held online on November, 6th 2020, at 14:00.   Chair:  Prof. Pier Luigi Parcu, Director of the Centrefor Media Pluralism and Media Freedom  Speakers:  Urška Umek (Head ofMedia Unit, Information Society Department, Council of Europe) RicardoGutiérrez (General Secretary, European Federation of Journalists) Mar Cabra (journalist, founder of The Self-Investigation project)  The COVID-19 crisis has highlighted more than ever the importance of professional journalism and quality reporting in our contemporary societies. The CMPF’s Media Pluralism Monitor 2020 has found that the poor working conditions ofjournalists and the increasing number of threats to which journalists aresubjected pose some of the greatest risks to journalism in Europe. In themonths following the data collection, the pandemic has further accelerated these problems. In these extraordinary times, journalists have put their health and well-being at risk to provide quality news to citizens, while the infodemic is raging. However, despite their fundamental role, news media and journalists are facing a series of challenges that could greatly impair function: financial difficulties, constant attacks to the freedom of expression, and at times even physical attacks. In the webinar session, distinguished experts will discuss the major security threats looming over the journalistic profession: The acquittal of the accused mastermind of Ján Kuciak’s murder has shown that perpetrators are shielded by impunity, even inside the EU. At our borders, in Belarus, authorities are detaining journalists for simply doing their job and covering protests. Butif we look beyond the headlines, we can find a range of additional problems affecting journalists in Europe — among them burn-outs, job (in)security and precarious employment, all of which were accelerated by COVID-19.   REGISTER HERE"	""	"""Special Event – European Journalism Facing COVID-19: A dialogue with Věra Jourová"	"20.11.2020 14:00"		"European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Věra Jourová In the first Annual Report on the Rule of Law situation inthe European Union published in September 2020, the European Commission evaluated the media pluralism and freedom situation in the 27 member states and raised some issues regarding media practices. Among those exist concerns about the political independence of media, the risks of politicisation of media authorities, threats to journalists in retaliation for their work, the scarcity of adequate resources for new media outlets, and more.  The COVID-19 pandemic crisis has further aggravated this situation and many measures taken to tackle the ‘infodemic’ appeared to be used for political purposes. In this context, what are the next steps planned by the European Commission to support the media sector? The Robert Schuman Centreand The Centre for Media Pluralism and Freedom are honoured to host European Commission Vice-President for Values and Transparency, Věra Jourová,to answer that question. The dialogue will feature an introduction from the Director of the Robert Schuman Centre, Brigid Laffan and will be chaired by Centre for Media Pluralism and Media Freedom Director, Pier Luigi Parcu.           The special event is organised in the context of this year’s CMPF Online School for Journalists and Media Practitioners.  "	""	"Online""Public roundtable “Together for the future of Europe – Digital transformation in the European way?”"	"10.12.2020 10:00"		"  CMPF Scientific Coordinator, Elda Brogi, will be a guest speaker at the roundtable “Together for the future of Europe – Digital transformation in the European way?” The event forms part of a cycle of online events, “Together for the Future of Europe.” Here you may find the programme of the event and registration."
